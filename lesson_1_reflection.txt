How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It pinpointed the location of the difference of the files in certain lines

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could find previous working versions in case the program gets broken

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Each version you make has a logical change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    They work depending on user's needs. Generally programmers need to track 
    multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log will help me find commit ID and git diff helps find differences in 
    files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I'll know that I can easily track down what's causing the problem

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For keeping version control of my files
